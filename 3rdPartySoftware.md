# Third-Party Software

Every software dependency of `emergent-matter-sdm-view` that is **not** EmergentMatter first-party code: the packages resolved into this repository's environment, the build backend, and the third-party GitHub Actions its CI runs.

Versions are deliberately left out. They move on every lock refresh, and a list that churns on every bump stops being read. For the exact pinned version of anything below, see `uv.lock`.

## Direct dependencies

## Build and CI toolchain

Third-party software the repository is built and tested with, rather than packages it imports.

| Component | Role | License |
|---|---|---|
| [Python](https://www.python.org/) | Language runtime | PSF-2.0 |
| [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) | Dependency resolver and installer | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| [`hatchling`](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) | Build backend, `[build-system] requires` | MIT |
| [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) | CI: checks out the repository | MIT |
| [`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) | CI: uploads build artifacts | MIT |
| [`astral-sh/setup-uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv) | CI: installs `uv` | MIT |

## First-party, deliberately not listed

These are EmergentMatter's own code and are out of scope for this file:

- Any `emergent-matter-*` package, and `sdm-view`
- `EmergentMatter/actions`, the shared release and changelog workflows

## Notes

- `mypy-extensions` publishes no license metadata to PyPI. MIT is taken from the `LICENSE` file in its upstream repository.
- `pathspec` is MPL-2.0, which is file-level copyleft. Unmodified transitive dependency, so the obligation is to keep the notices intact, which distributing them unmodified does.
- No GPL or LGPL licensed package appears in this repository's tree.
- The `setup-node` and `setup-bun` steps in `.github/workflows/` sit inside commented-out template blocks, and this repository has no `package.json`, so it has no JavaScript dependencies.

## Regenerating

Direct entries come from `pyproject.toml`; transitive entries are every remaining package in `uv.lock` that is not first-party. Licenses come from installed package metadata, falling back to PyPI.
